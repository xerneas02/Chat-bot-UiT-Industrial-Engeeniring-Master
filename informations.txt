A Master of Science degree in Industrial Engineering will provide students with the knowledge and capabilities to use appropriate techniques, skills, and tools to identify, formulate, analyze, and solve complex problems in both engineering and management. 
With normal progress, a student will be able to obtain a master degree after two years, corresponding to 120 credits. 
If the student wants to combine the master study with work in an external company, it is possible to extend the program to three or four years. 
A customized education plan will then be suggested. After finishing this education, students will have a solid foundation to enter a variety of positions at global base. 
The typical positions are senior engineer, project managers, developers, consultants, managers and researchers. Many of our former students are holding managerial or senior research positions in public organizations or private companies. 
What sets our program apart is its unwavering commitment to sustainability, resilience, and human-centered systems and technologies. 
As a student, you'll have exclusive access to state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment, including Robots, Cobots (Universals Robots, arms that can to lot of various tasks), Autonomous vehicles, Hybrid and metal printers, Virtual and augmented reality systems, and much more. 
Historically, our M.Sc program has attracted a diverse and dynamic cohort of students from around the globe.

UiT Norges arktiske Universitet as a bustling campus anchored by the F Building. 
This central hub serves as the university's heart, housing the main entrance.  
Think of it as a grand hall where you'll find the student administration right as you walk in. Branching out from the F Building on either side, you'll encounter two distinct sections.  
On one side lies a cluster of buildings - A, B, and C.  These are the academic powerhouses, where classrooms and faculty offices hum with activity. Across from the academic core, on the other side of the F Building, things take on a more social and activity-oriented vibe.  
This area is dominated by the E Building.  Here, you can grab a bite to eat at the restaurant, delve into a book at the library offering a haven for quiet study, or get your heart pumping at the indoor training center, complete with a climbing wall. 
The E Building also houses the student pub, the perfect spot to unwind and socialize with fellow students after a long day of classes. 
The main entrance and service center are situated within the F Building itself, ensuring easy access for students and faculty. $$
